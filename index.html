         <h1>Celebrate Black History Month</h1>
         <article>It was Carter G. Woodson, the "father of Black history," who first set out in 1926 to
             designate a time to promote and educate people about Black history and culture, and to make the celebration of Black history in the field of history a 
              'serious area of study'.
              The idea eventually grew in acceptance, and by the late 1960s, Negro History Week had evolved into 
              what is now known as Black History Month. 
            Fifty years after the first celebrations, President Gerald R. Ford 
            officially recognized Black History Month during the country's 1976 bicentennial.

                    <p> Clay struggled to find work in technology. He taught himself to code, and by 1958 was a programmer at Lawrence
                     Livermore National Laboratory.His early work involved creating a radiation tracking system to study the aftermath 
                     of a nuclear explosion.
         
                     Clay joined Hewlett-Packard (HP), where he helped to launch and lead the Computer Science division in 1965. 
                     Clay went on to develop software languages for Control Data mainframe computers, 
                     before joining Hewlett-Packard as the lead developer for the HP 2116A (Hewlett-Packard's first minicomputer).
                     Whilst working at HP Clay developed several initiatives to improve the representation of African-Americans in Silicon Valley.
   
                     He founded ROD-L Electronics, which is recognised not only for its technical innovation and focus on safety within the electronic industry, 
                     but also for its community work.</p>
